These Posts and Articles will be one important base for the information store of the NeoNomadia project. After they have been validated against violations of the code of conduct, they will be parsed by the Content Extraction AI similar to the Linked Page Evaluation but with the fortune of possibly having some more context relations than on a single Web Page.</p> <p>This process is started automatically, whenever a new Post or Article is added by using the NeoNomadia API.</p> <p>According to the moderated AI concept it always generates exactly one Dynamic Form with the related categories, labels and tokens. The Content Extraction AI decides itself for completenes and correctness of the generated content cross-referencing against the NeoNomadia Category Catalog, Label Catalog, Dialog Graph Token Catalog and the Dialog Graph Catalog. If the confidentiality rate (AI confidence in classification accuracy) is below 99%, the Dynamic Form is scheduled to be picked up by an information provider to be checked and stored.</p> <p>This links the Post or Article for the unstructured document store.</p> <p>If the first scan resulted in multiple major categories, a second run extracts multiple Dynamic Forms with the related categories, labels and tokens. The further process is similar to the first scan with the difference, that the Dynamic Forms contain content extracts and not the full document, and a result is finally stored in the structured fact store. </p> <p>A further validation process for each informational item against internal information and public available information prevents from getting flooded with alternative facts and troll content. If this validation is not passed, the related Dynamic Form is always scheduled for a review, independent from the confidentiality rate.</p>"},{"location":"vision/big-picture/the-guide/","title":"The Guide","text":"<p>The Guide serves as the user's navigator through NeoNomadia\u2019s ever-growing information universe.

Each interaction is tokenized and saved as a dialog graph, enabling the user to step backward or forward through their conversation history.</p> <p>Dialog graphs are stored in relation to either the session or the user, depending on whether temporary or persistent storage has been selected. When a dialog graph appears for the first time, it is stored (anonymized) in a central graph database \u2014 ensuring that future conversations can benefit from accelerated suggestions and contextual awareness.</p> <p>This first stage serves two purposes: to deliver an early MVP and to lay the foundation for Stage Two \u2014 the free chat system.</p>"},{"location":"vision/big-picture/the-guide/#the-free-chat-system","title":"The free chat system","text":"<p>The second stage introduces open text input. Users can simply write, and the system tokenizes the input in relation to the guided dialog graph from Stage One. Missing information can be requested, context gaps filled, and guided refinement encouraged. This architecture minimizes computational effort, limits confidentiality risks, and prevents out-of-scope usage.</p> <p>Unlike a general-purpose AI system, the free chat interface is intentionally limited: it will not provide investment advice, explain unrelated scientific concepts, or locate car dealerships. Instead, its responses remain anchored to NeoNomadia\u2019s vision. Dialog graphs are stored (when permitted) to preserve context, enable navigation, and support comparison across user journeys.</p> <p>The system is also designed to learn.
