## NeoNomadia Vision Statement

**We the people are part of a world in motion** — seeking work, striving for a better future, and responding to climate change, ethnical, religious, and political conflicts, gender-based inequality, or the violation of fundamental human rights, including identity and self-expression.

**A global trend of exclusion has emerged** — driven by nationalism, fear, and the erosion of empathy. The accelerating movement has stirred unease in many nations — particularly across the northern hemisphere, including the European Union and the United States. In response, political agendas have shifted toward restriction: borders are tightening, immigration policies hardening, and hard-won social rights being deliberately reversed.

**NeoNomadia stands in opposition to this trend.** We aim to challenge the revival of nationalism and the erosion of empathy. Our mission is to help those who are displaced, uprooted, or simply seeking a new place to belong. Through the barriers and the harshness, we want to illuminate the pathways to communities that welcome, support, and learn from each other.

This neo-isolationism doesn’t stop at national borders — it now permeates neighborhoods, cities, even online spaces. That’s why NeoNomadia extends its support to those navigating internal displacement and relocation, within one country or across cultures.

**Inclusion is the compass guiding every aspect of the NeoNomadia project.** Anyone who embraces others with respect and openness — regardless of origin, background, identity (including LGBTQ+), or path — deserves to be seen, heard, and welcomed into our growing community.

**While the United Nations strives to define a framework of rules guiding the behavior of nations, this remains an immensely complex and imperfect pursuit.** The NeoNomadia project seeks to translate those lofty ideals into everyday action — carried out not by governments or leaders, but by individuals. Because people are far more than their representation on paper or through political systems. Our empathy, our capacity to care and connect, cannot be legislated — it must be lived.
