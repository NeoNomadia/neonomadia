# Design Decisions

## Project Language

The primary language for communication and documentation — including code comments — is **English**.

In cases involving country-specific, ethnic, or linguistic topics, using the respective local language may be appropriate. However, whenever possible, an accompanying English translation should be provided to ensure clarity and inclusivity across the project.


## Project Management System

The selection of a project management system remains open. The tool must encourage **simplicity**, making it easy for all potential contributors to engage comfortably.

Another key factor is **role management** — the system should support well-defined contributor roles that reflect NeoNomadia’s collaborative ethos.

This decision will be revisited once the initial roadmap is finalized and the project's evolving vision offers greater clarity on long-term requirements.

## Corporate Design

NeoNomadia is visually anchored by a distinctive logo, primarily designed for use on the project website:

![neonomadia logo](../../resources/neonomadia-full-logo-225.png)

This logo establishes the project's core color palette:

| Color Name | RGB | HEX Code |
|------------|-----|----------|
| <span style="color: #0A2438">**Dark Blue**</span> | 10, 36, 56 | #0A2438 |
| <span style="color: #29525C">**Turquoise**</span> | 41, 82, 92 | #29525C |
| <span style="color: #2E666B">**Light Turquoise**</span> | 46, 102, 107 | #2E666B |
| <span style="color: #F69B2F">**Light Orange**</span> | 246, 155, 47 | #F69B2F |

All additional design elements must align with this visual identity to maintain a coherent and recognizable presence across media.

The preferred typeface is **Noto Sans**, chosen for its modern clarity and wide multilingual support.
