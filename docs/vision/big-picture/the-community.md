# The Community

There are numerous social media platforms out there — Facebook and Mastodon, X (formerly Twitter), TikTok and Instagram, WhatsApp and Telegram. So, defining a new community requires a clear vision of its intended purpose.

## What we want

- We want to connect people and help them build local networks of interest.
- We want to provide a safe space for self-expression.
- We want to give social organizations a place to be seen and heard.
- We want newcomers to feel welcome in their cities, villages, and communities.
- We want to help people find support, advice, and friendship.
- We want to celebrate the diversity of cultures, individuals, and the stories behind them.
- We want to encourage people to support and enrich the NeoNomadia universe.

## What we don't want

- We don't want to become a commercial platform fueled by personal data and monetized through advertising or, worse, data exploitation.
- We don't want to be a venue for propaganda, misinformation, government statements, or political party messaging.
- We don't want to accept algorithmic manipulation of what people see — or of what people think.
- We don't want to become a breeding ground for radicalization or extremist movements of any kind.
- We don't want to pressure community members to stay active or log in frequently.
- We don't want to replace real-world friendships. Nothing compares to real-world friends.
