# Administration

Beyond standard interfaces for engineers, administrators, and project dashboards, this section governs the registration and management of key participant roles:

- **Contributors**
- **Users**
- **Consumers**
- **Associates**

Project management itself is not part of this interface. Currently, administrative oversight is grounded in the GitHub Organization. Future refinements may be introduced if specific needs arise.

Like all other parts of the API, this category must adhere to rigorous standards of data security and protection â€” especially given its potential exposure as a system-wide control layer.
