## NeoNomadia Vision Statement

**We the people are part of a world in motion** — seeking work, striving for a better future, and responding to climate change, ethnical, religious, and political conflicts, gender-based inequality, or the violation of fundamental human rights, including identity and self-expression.

**A global trend of exclusion has emerged** — driven by nationalism, fear, and the erosion of empathy. The accelerating movement has stirred unease in many nations — particularly across the northern hemisphere, including the European Union and the United States. In response, political agendas have shifted toward restriction: borders are tightening, immigration policies hardening, and hard-won social rights being deliberately reversed.

**NeoNomadia stands in opposition to this trend.** We aim to challenge the revival of nationalism and the erosion of empathy. Our mission is to help those who are displaced, uprooted, or simply seeking a new place to belong. Through the barriers and the harshness, we want to illuminate the pathways to communities that welcome, support, and learn from each other.

This neo-isolationism doesn’t stop at national borders — it now permeates neighborhoods, cities, even online spaces. That’s why NeoNomadia extends its support to those navigating internal displacement and relocation, within one country or across cultures.

**Inclusion is the compass guiding every aspect of the NeoNomadia project.** Anyone who embraces others with respect and openness — regardless of origin, background, identity (including LGBTQ+), or path — deserves to be seen, heard, and welcomed into our growing community.

**While the United Nations strives to define a framework of rules guiding the behavior of nations, this remains an immensely complex and imperfect pursuit.** The NeoNomadia project seeks to translate those lofty ideals into everyday action — carried out not by governments or leaders, but by individuals. Because people are far more than their representation on paper or through political systems. Our empathy, our capacity to care and connect, cannot be legislated — it must be lived.

## How NeoNomadia Pursues Its Vision

NeoNomadia transforms inclusive ideals into action through a framework grounded in openness, modularity, and people-first design. Rather than relying on centralized authorities, we build tools and ecosystems that empower communities to self-organize, connect, and support each other across borders and barriers.

Our strategy is shaped by three implementation pillars:

**1. Decentralized Infrastructure**

We develop open-source platforms that facilitate human mobility and cultural exchange. These tools are designed to:

- Be accessible across languages, identities, and backgrounds  
- Enable discovery of welcoming communities and resources  
- Respect privacy, autonomy, and inclusive design principles

Everything is built to function independently — but interconnect whenever needed.

**2. Community-Driven Development**

NeoNomadia evolves through the contributions of developers, activists, artists, educators, and everyday nomads. We provide:

- Public documentation and transparent APIs  
- Entry points for non-technical collaborators  
- Flexible governance models for participatory decision-making

The architecture isn’t imposed — it’s nurtured through shared values and use cases.

**3. Interlinked Project Ecosystem**

NeoNomadia isn’t a monolith — it's a constellation. Through related initiatives like Embera.world and others to come, we create:

- Shared standards for interoperability  
- Design languages and APIs that allow seamless cooperation  
- A growing network of projects aligned by inclusion and mobility

Each project maintains its voice, yet speaks a common dialect.

## The Big Picture

Even if every journey begins with a first step — and the road ahead is long — it’s essential to know where you’re heading. That’s why we need the big picture, and we’ll begin painting it here — for you, and for ourselves.

The **NeoNomadia** project is clearly defined as a **backend provider**, intended to be accessed by external consumers via a wide-range **API**. This API is responsible for key pillars of data management: **security**, **data projection**, **data integrity**, **data quality**, and GDPR-compliant **data sovereignty**. All aspects of the social contract between users and the project — including the restriction of racist, discriminatory, or offensive content — are governed centrally within the API. These values are enforced at the backend level and cannot be delegated to external consumers. The API provides processed output only (e.g. JSON or XML). The raw data remains encapsulated within the backend and is not publicly accessible.

The **NeoNomadia API** is designed around five main categories: **Session Control**, **Administration**, **The Guide**, **The Environment**, and **The Community**. The first two govern backend infrastructure — handling authentication, roles, access rules, configuration, and service orchestration. The latter three are deeply tied to the user experience and define the primary streams through which individuals will interact with the system. These pillars — The Guide, The Environment, and The Community — reflect NeoNomadia’s core intention: to provide navigational support, contextual awareness, and inclusive connection across the landscapes of identity, location, and belonging.

- [**Session Control**](big-picture/session-control.md) — Handles access authentication, permissions, and session integrity.
- [**Administration**](big-picture/administration.md) — Manages project-level rules, moderation, configuration, and systemic transparency.
- [**The Guide**](big-picture/the-guide.md) — Provides personalized navigation for each user through the NeoNomadia universe, integrating facts from the Environment and posts from the Community.
- [**The Environment**](big-picture/the-environment.md) — Offers an interface for handling all facts related to locations or topics, including an import layer for external fact providers.
- [**The Community**](big-picture/the-community.md) — Facilitates interaction, support networks, contribution spaces, and civic participation.

In addition, we offer deeper reflections as part of the Big Picture:

- [**The Moderated AI Concept**](big-picture/moderated-ai-concept.md) — exploring the meaning and conceptual foundations of moderated AI within the NeoNomadia project
- [**Derived Sub Projects**](big-picture/sub-projects.md) — a brief overview of initiatives closely aligned with, or initiated by, NeoNomadia to help ensure its success

## Founding Declaration

As soon as the vision statement is finalized, NeoNomadia will be officially founded. Thank you for your patience during this formative phase — setting up and documenting a meaningful initiative is a slow but essential process.
